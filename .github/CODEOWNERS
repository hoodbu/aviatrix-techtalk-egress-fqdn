# When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews,
# they also can optionally require approval from a code owner before the author 
# can merge a pull request in the repository. The operations-group most like owns
# this repository, with the development-group able to author and push pull requests

# In a true org structure, this line would be something like: "fqdn-rules.tf @security-group"
fqdn-rules.tf @jb-smoker

# In a true org structure, I'd suggest there would also be:
# fqdn-infra.tf @operations-group
